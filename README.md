# Privacy-Preserving Federated Deep-Learning in Healthcare: A Proof-of-Concept Implementation
This repo shows a proof-of-concept implementation of privacy-preserving federated learning for clinical depression screening, demonstrating how healthcare institutions can collaboratively train AI models without compromising on patient data and privacy. The implementation includes differential privacy, secure aggregation, and fine-tuning using LoRA adapters to address the challenge of multi-institutional healthcare AI collaboration.

## Short Summary & Problem Statement
This readme shows a federated learning framework that enables hospitals to jointly develop depression screening models while maintaining mathematical privacy guarantees and preventing any raw patient data from leaving institutional boundaries. Healthcare institutions and hospitals need large and representative datasets to train effective AI models, but patient privacy regulations and institutional policies prevent data sharing. This creates isolated data silos that limit the potential for better model learning. In this implementation, the Hugging Face dataset moremilk/CoT_Reasoning_Clinical_Diagnosis_Mental_Health is used as a proxy dataset to simulate clinical reasoning for mental health diagnoses, including depression, rather than real hospital or healthcare institution records.

## Technical Architecture
### 1. Dual-Language Architecture
Two separate AI models are used to complement each other. The main model is ClinicalBERT with 110 million parameters, which specializes in understanding medical language because it was trained on doctor notes and medical papers. This model stays frozen during training to preserve its medical knowledge. The second model is Flan-T5 with 77 million parameters, which generates explanations for the predictions made by the first model. This explanation model helps doctors understand why the AI made certain decisions and gets specifically trained to explain medical reasoning.

### 2. Finetuning With LoRA
The system uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with the following LoRA configuration:
├── Rank (r): 16
├── Alpha (α): 32  
├── Dropout: 0.1
└── Target Modules: [query, value, key, dense]

The design is such that only hospitals only share these small LoRA adapter weights with each other, never the full model weights. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be communicated between hospitals, while keeping the model's performance intact.

### 3. Two-Head Architecture
**Head A: Depression Screening**
The first part of the model classifies depression into four severity levels: none, mild, moderate, or severe. It uses Monte Carlo Dropout to measure how uncertain the prediction is. Temperature scaling adjusts the confidence scores to make them more accurate. The system also detects when it encounters unusual cases that don't fit normal patterns.
**Head B: Rationale Generation**
The second part explains why the model made its prediction by generating clinical reasoning. It connects to a medical knowledge database to provide context. The system identifies and highlights specific depression symptoms it detected. This creates clear, interpretable pathways that show how the AI reached its conclusion.

Multi-domain coverage (symptoms, diagnoses, treatment rationales)
MIT licensed for research applications

Semantic Feature Extraction:
Using ClinicalBERT embeddings, the system extracts semantic similarity scores for 11 depression criteria:

Low mood, anhedonia, sleep problems
Fatigue, appetite changes, guilt/worthlessness
Concentration problems, psychomotor changes
Suicidal thoughts, functional impairment, duration criteria

Hospital Data Partitioning Strategy:
pythonHospital A (Geriatric Focus):     1,046 cases - Conservative privacy (ε=0.2)
Hospital B (Young Adult Focus):     126 cases - Moderate privacy (ε=0.3)
Hospital C (Mixed Urban):         1,834 cases - Balanced privacy (ε=0.25)
Federated Learning Protocol
Communication Round Structure:

Eligibility Check: Verify remaining privacy budgets
On-Demand Model Creation: Instantiate hospital models only when needed
Local Training: 1 epoch with gradient clipping and dropout
Privacy Noise Addition: Gaussian noise calibrated to ε-δ parameters
Secure Aggregation: Weighted averaging without exposing individual updates
Memory Management: Immediate model deletion and GPU cache clearing

Memory Optimization for Resource-Constrained Environments:

On-demand model instantiation prevents simultaneous large model loading
Aggressive GPU memory management with torch.mps.empty_cache()
Reduced batch sizes (8 instead of 16) for Apple M1 compatibility
Immediate tensor deletion after gradient computation

Clinical Feature Analysis:
Show Image
The depression criteria analysis reveals significant feature imbalance in the clinical dataset. Guilt/worthlessness symptoms appear in 99.3% of cases (2979/3000), creating a dominant signal that may bias model learning. Low mood presents in 35.1% of cases, while sleep problems affect 8.0%. All other clinical criteria show detection rates below 2%, indicating either genuine rarity in the dataset or limitations in the semantic similarity approach for identifying these symptoms.
The feature correlation heatmap demonstrates moderate correlations between related symptoms (fatigue-appetite changes: 0.61, mood-functional impairment: 0.43), suggesting the semantic embedding approach captures clinically meaningful relationships.
Show Image
The semantic score analysis shows a normal distribution centered at 0.655, with quartiles at Q1: 0.641, Q2: 0.655, Q3: 0.668. This distribution validates the semantic similarity approach, as scores cluster around the depression threshold (0.65) rather than showing extreme values. The cumulative distribution indicates that 58.9% of cases fall in the high-confidence range (>0.65), 39.4% in medium confidence (0.6-0.65), and only 1.7% in low confidence (<0.6).
Show Image
Hospital-specific analysis reveals significant data heterogeneity that validates the federated learning approach. Hospital A shows higher depression scores (0.661 mean) with broader distribution, Hospital B demonstrates the highest depression prevalence (84.1%) but smallest dataset, and Hospital C has the most diverse score distribution but lowest prevalence (54.8%). This heterogeneity across institutions demonstrates why federated learning is necessary - no single hospital has a representative sample of the full depression spectrum.

Critical Analysis and Limitations
Clinical Performance Assessment
Fundamental Challenge: The clinical screening performance is effectively at random chance levels. This reflects several critical limitations:
1. Insufficient Training Scale

Training Duration: Only 1 epoch per federated round due to computational constraints
Limited Rounds: Single federated communication round completed
Resource Constraints: Apple M1 GPU memory limitations (18GB) restricted training intensity

2. Synthetic Labeling Limitations
pythonLabel Generation Method:
if score < 0.6 or criteria_count == 0: → No Depression
elif score < 0.65 or criteria_count <= 2: → Mild Depression  
elif score < 0.7 or criteria_count <= 4: → Moderate Depression
else: → Severe Depression

Labels derived from semantic similarity, not clinical diagnoses
High inter-rater disagreement likely with real clinical labels
Semantic features may not capture true diagnostic complexity

3. Class Imbalance Issues
Severe Label Imbalance Observed:
├── Hospital A: 617 mild, 18 none, 182 moderate, 19 severe
├── Hospital B: 94 mild, 1 none, 2 moderate, 3 severe
└── Hospital C: 1459 mild, 6 none, 2 moderate, 0 severe
4. Domain Adaptation Challenges

ClinicalBERT pre-trained on clinical notes, not Q&A reasoning tasks
Flan-T5 optimized for general instruction following, not clinical reasoning
Limited domain-specific fine-tuning due to computational constraints
